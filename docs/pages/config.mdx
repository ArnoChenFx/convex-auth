# Configure Authentication Methods

Now you need to choose how you want your users to authenticate.

If you're just getting started for the first time, we recommend using
[Magic Links](/config/email) with Resend as the email service provider. This is
the simplest method to set up.

If you don't want to use any other service you can use
[Passwords](/config/passwords) without password recovery.

Eventually most apps support one or more OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, Apple
etc.), and pair them with either email sign-in via Magic Link / OTP or with a
traditional email + password combination.

If you know which methods you want to support click on the links below and
follow the method specific guide:

1. [Magic Links & OTPs](/config/email) (send a link or code via email)
2. [OAuth](/config/oauth) (sign in with Github / Google / Apple etc.)
3. [Passwords](/config/passwords) (including password reset flow and optional
   email verification)

## Understand the tradeoffs

There are DX, UX and security tradeoffs between these methods, and you have to
decide which method is right for your application. Read on to learn more about
the tradeoffs.

### Magic Links & OTPs

**DX considerations:**

- ❗️ Magic links & OTPs require configuring an email provider / server, which in
  turn usually requires controlling a web domain.
- 👍 Magic links have the simplest implementation of all the methods.
- ⏱️ Currently we don't have a guide for using magic links with React Native.

**UX considerations:**

- ❗️ Magic links & OTPs require the user to access their email every time they
  want to sign in on a new device, after a previous sign out or after their
  session expires.
- 👍 Magic links & OTPs don’t require the user to come up with and remember a
  password or use having a password manager installed.
- ❗️ Magic links make it hard to sign in on a device where the user cannot
  easily access their email inbox.
- 👍 OTPs make it easy to sign in on a device where the user cannot easily
  access their email inbox (compared to magic links).

**Security considerations:**

- ❗️ Magic links can be used for phishing: an attacker can send a genuine magic
  link that signs in the victim to the attacker’s account.
- ❗️ OTPs can be used for phishing: an attacker can send a genuine OTP for the
  victim’s account to the victim’s email, and then ask the victim to share the
  code to sign in as the victim.

### OAuth

**DX considerations:**

- ❗️ OAuth requires configuring the OAuth provider, which in turn usually
  requires controlling a web domain and might involve additional verification
  steps. The DX of the OAuth configuration is usually far from ideal.
- 👍 OAuth providers carry the burden of correctly implementing other
  authentication methods and features: passwords, email verification, MFA, SSO,
  etc.
- ⏱️ Currently Convex Auth doesn't support using OAuth with React Native.

**UX considerations:**

- 👍 OAuth is very user friendly because most users will already be signed in
  with the OAuth provider and only need to authorize your app.
- ❗️ OAuth requires the user to have an account with one of the OAuth providers
  you chose. If they don’t, and if they don’t want to create one, they will not
  be able to sign in via this method.

**Security considerations:**

- 👍 OAuth security relies on the OAuth provider’s security, which is usually
  strong given the amount of resources the providers have.

### Passwords

**DX considerations:**

- 😐 Production-ready passwords implementation requires configuring an email
  provider / server for password recovery, which in turn usually requires
  controlling a web domain.
- ❗️ Passwords have the most complex implementation.

**UX considerations:**

- 👍 Passwords are fairly user-friendly for users with password managers
  installed.
- ❗️ Passwords require users without password managers to come up with and
  remember a password.

**Security considerations:**

- ❗️ People are prone to reusing passwords which allows an attacker to use a
  password stolen from an insecure application or from a phishing attack.
- ❗️ Your application must not leak password in any way (such as through
  inadvertent logging during the authentication flow).
