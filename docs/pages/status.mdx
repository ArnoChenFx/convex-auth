## FAQs

### Why should I use Convex Auth instead of NextAuth?

- NextAuth (Auth.js) requires a Next.js (or similar) server. Convex Auth works
  with and without a Next.js server, you can use it directly from an SPA hosted
  on a CDN.
- Convex Auth by running directly and only on your Convex backend avoids some of
  the complexity of syncing state between two servers.
- Convex Auth has built-in support for OTP and email+passwords methods

### Why should I use Convex Auth instead of Clerk or Auth0?

- Convex Auth doesnâ€™t require signing up for another service besides Convex and
  an email provider (unless you use OAuth providers like Google or Github, but
  you would have to set these up with Clerk/Auth0 later anyway).
- Convex Auth is simpler because it stores all user data directly in your Convex
  database. It doesn't require syncing state from an external database.
- Convex Auth doesn't require owning a top-level domain (like `example.com`),
  although your email provider might.
- We still recommend Clerk and Auth0 as featureful auth solutions.

### Why should I use Convex Auth instead of Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth?

- Firebase and Supabase Auth store user data in their respective databases.
  Convex Auth stores user data directly in your Convex database.
- Convex Auth includes basic functionality included in Firebase/Supabase Auth.
  For advanced authentication functionality (SSO, MFA, etc.) we recommend using
  Clerk or Auth0.
