# OAuth

> Make sure you're done with [setup](/setup) before configuring authentication
> methods

This authentication method has two steps:

1. The user clicks on a button to sign-in with a third-party (GitHub, Google,
   Apple etc.)
2. The user authenticates on the third-party website and is redirected back to
   your app and signed in

Convex Auth ensures a secure exchange of secrets between the third-party
provider and your backend.

OAuth isn't supported for React Native yet.

## Providers

Convex Auth implements configuration via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
"provider" configs. These JS objects define how the library interfaces with an
OAuth provider.

You can use any of the 80 OAuth providers preconfigured by Auth.js, including
GitHub, Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.

You can find the list of available providers and more details about each
configuration in the sidebar of
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/github).

Choose an OAuth provider (for example _GitHub_) and follow the guide below.

_Ignore the "database provider" configuration in Auth.js docs. Your Convex
backend is your database!_

Are you setting up OAuth for the first time? We recommend using
_GitHub_.

Github has better-than-most configuration DX, even if it is not a very good
choice for apps targeting the general population.

Google, which is very popular among users, unfortunately has a very complicated
OAuth setup and documentation.

## Setup

<Steps>

### Callback URL

After you sign up as a developer with the provider you usually create an "app"
(or similar) to store your OAuth configuration.

Among other things you might need to configure you will usually need to specify
a "callback" URL, and potentially other URLs/domains.

The origin (domain) of the callback URL for Convex Auth is your backend's HTTP
Actions URL, which you can find on your
[Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings). It matches
your `CONVEX_URL` except for the the top-level domain being `.site` instead of
`.cloud`.

For example, if your deployment name was `fast-horse-123`, then your HTTP
Actions URL would be `https://fast-horse-123.convex.site` and your callback URL
for _GitHub_ would be:

```
https://fast-horse-123.convex.site/api/auth/callback/github
```

### Environment variables

Configure the relevant environment variables for a given OAuth provider, as per
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers), on your Convex
backend.

[Setting environment variables Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#setting-environment-variables).

For example for _GitHub_ you can run (with your own values):

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_ID yourgithubclientid
npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET yourgithubsecret
```

Also check that the `SITE_URL` variable has the correct port number
[configured](/setup/manual#configure-site_url).

### Provider configuration

Add the provider config to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`.

Import Auth.js providers from `@auth/core/providers`. For example for _GitHub_:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import GitHub from "@auth/core/providers/github";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store } = convexAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
});
```

### Add sign-in button

Now you can trigger the OAuth sign-in flow from a button click via the Convex
Auth `signIn` function.

The first argument to the function is the provider ID, which unless customized
is a lowercase version of the provider name. For example for _GitHub_:

```tsx filename="src/SignIn.tsx"
import { useAuthActions } from "@convex-dev/auth/react";

export function SignIn() {
  const { signIn } = useAuthActions();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => void signIn("github")}>Sign in with GitHub</button>
  );
}
```

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/src/auth/oauth/SignInWithGitHub.tsx)
for a more polished UI.

You can control which page the user will be redirect to after the sign-in by
passing a `redirectTo` param to the `signIn` function. See
[`redirect` callback](/api_reference/server#callbacksredirect).

</Steps>

When you're done configuring your chosen authentication methods, learn how to
use authentication in your frontend and backend in [Authorization](/authz).

## Production setup

It's usually not possible to share the same OAuth provider "app", the entity
configured on the third-party dashboard, between your development and production
environments.

In development your app is usually running on `localhost`, while in production
it will be hosted on a public server and have a proper assigned URL.

Therefore you will have to create a separate "app" on the third-party dashboard
for each environment, and configure the [callback URL](#callback-url) and
[environment variables](#environment-variables) accordingly.

Don't forget to also
[configure your SITE_URL](/setup/manual/#configure-site_url).

## Retrieving other profile information

By default, only `name`, `email` and `image` sourced from the OAuth profile are
saved in the `users` table.

You can find the logic for sourcing these fields
[here](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth/blob/main/src/server/provider_utils.ts#L92-L99).

You can customize this logic via the `profile` method on the OAuth provider
config:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import GitHub from "@auth/core/providers/github";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store } = convexAuth({
  providers: [
    GitHub({
      profile(githubProfile, tokens) {
        return {
          id: githubProfile.id,
          name: githubProfile.name,
          email: githubProfile.email,
          image: githubProfile.picture,
          githubId: githubProfile.id,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

The example above adds a `githubId` field. You must
[customize your schema](/setup/schema) to include this field.

To implement the `profile` method correctly you must understand the profile
information the particular OAuth provider returns. Consult their documentation.

The method must return an `id` field with a unique ID, which is used to identify
the [account](/auth/advanced#account-linking).
