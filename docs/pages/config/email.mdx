# Magic Links & OTPs

This authentication method has two steps:

1. The user provides an email, to which a link or one-time-password (OTP) code
   is sent
2. The user either clicks on the link or fills out the code on the website

Either way your database keeps track of the issued "token" that was sent which
allows for secure verification and expiration.

React Native can only use OTPs for now.

## Providers

Convex Auth supports configuration via Auth.js providers. See the the
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email) for a
list of available email providers.

After you picked the email service, choose between:

- [Magic Links](#magic-link-setup)
- [OTPs](#otps-setup)

## Magic Link Setup

<Steps>

### Environment variables

Configure the relevant environment variables for a given email provider, as per
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email), on your
Convex backend.

See
[setting environment variables Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#setting-environment-variables).

For example for Resend you can run (with your own value):

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_RESEND_KEY yourresendkey
```

### Provider configuration

Add the provider to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`.

You can import Auth.js providers from `@auth/core/providers`. For example for
Resend:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import Resend from "@auth/core/providers/resend";
import { convexAuth } from "@xixixao/convex-auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, verifyCode, signOut, store } = convexAuth({
  providers: [Resend],
});
```

### Add sign-in form

Now you can trigger the email sending from a form submission via the `signIn`
function.

The first argument to the function is the provider ID, which unless customized
is a lowercase version of the provider name. For example for Resend:

```tsx filename="src/SignIn.tsx"
"use client";

import { useAuthActions } from "@xixixao/convex-auth/react";

export function SignIn() {
  const { signIn } = useAuthActions();
  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        void signIn("resend", formData);
      }}
    >
      <input name="email" placeholder="Email" type="text" />
      <button type="submit">Send sign-in link</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

[example repo](https://github.com/xixixao/convex-auth/blob/convex-auth-demo-src/app/auth/SignInFormEmailLink.tsx)
for a more polished UI.

</Steps>

## OTPs setup

You can send an OTP instead of a magic link (or both), by customizing any of the
email providers.

<Steps>

### Environment variables

Configure the relevant environment variables for a given email provider, as per
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email), on your
Convex backend.

See
[setting environment variables Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#setting-environment-variables).

For example for Resend you can run (with your own value):

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_RESEND_KEY yourresendkey
```

### Provider configuration

Create a custom provider for sending an OTP.

<Aside title="This example uses additional dependencies">

1. Resend and its SDK
2. Oslo, a handy library which is part of the Lucia project

You can install these with `npm i resend oslo`.

</Aside>

```ts convex/ResendOTP.ts
import Resend from "@auth/core/providers/resend";
import { Resend as ResendAPI } from "resend";
import { alphabet, generateRandomString } from "oslo/crypto";

export const ResendOTP = Resend({
  id: "resend-otp",
  async generateVerificationToken() {
    return generateRandomString(8, alphabet("0-9"));
  },
  async sendVerificationRequest({ identifier: email, provider, token }) {
    const resend = new ResendAPI(provider.apiKey);
    const { error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "My App <onboarding@resend.dev>",
      to: [email],
      subject: `Sign in to My App`,
      text: "Your code is " + token,
    });

    if (error) {
      throw new Error("Could not send");
    }
  },
});
```

Then use it in `convex/auth.ts`:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import { convexAuth } from "@xixixao/convex-auth/server";
import { ResendOTP } from "./ResendOTP";

export const { auth, signIn, verifyCode, signOut, store } = convexAuth({
  providers: [ResendOTP],
});
```

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/xixixao/convex-auth/blob/convex-auth-demo-src/convex/otp/ResendOTP.ts)
for a more polished email template.

You can find more examples of email customization in
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend#customization).

### Add sign-in form

Now you can trigger the email sending from a form submission via the `signIn`
function.

After the email is sent, you should show the second form for submitting the
code, which can be done via the `verifyCode` function.

For example for the custom `ResendOTP` provider:

```tsx filename="src/SignIn.tsx"
"use client";

import { useAuthActions } from "@xixixao/convex-auth/react";

export function SignIn() {
  const { signIn, verifyCode } = useAuthActions();
  const [step, setStep] = useState<"signIn" | "code">("signIn");
  return step === "signIn" ? (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        void signIn("resend-otp", formData).then(() => setStep("code"));
      }}
    >
      <input name="email" placeholder="Email" type="text" />
      <button type="submit">Send code</button>
    </form>
  ) : (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        void verifyCode("resend-otp", formData);
      }}
    >
      <input name="code" placeholder="Code" type="text" />
      <button type="submit">Continue</button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setStep("signIn")}>
        Cancel
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/xixixao/convex-auth/blob/convex-auth-demo-src/app/auth/SignInFormEmailCode.tsx)
for a more polished UI.

use authentication in your frontend and backend in [Authorization](/authz).
