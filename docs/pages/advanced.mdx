## Session validity

Convex Auth issues JWTs which allow your client to authenticate.

As far as the `ConvexReactClient` and the Convex backend with
`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` are concerned, the JWT is all that's needed for
valid authentication.

This means that when an existing session is invalidated (deleted), the user is
not automically signed out until the JWT expires.

If you want session validity to be reflected immediately, you need to actually
load the current session in your queries/mutations/actions, and you need to make
sure your client can handle the state where the JWT is valid but the session is
not.

Either way, for critical operations (changing account details) you should always
require either direct reauthentication or recent authentication. The current
session's `_creationTime` can be used to determine how recently the user has
signed in.

## Session document lifecycle

The session documents are created and deleted by Convex Auth.

For this reason if you're tying other documents to sessions, and you don't want
to lose information when the session expires, you should store both the session
ID and the user ID in your other document.
